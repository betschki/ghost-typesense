# Ghost Typesense tools

Ghost Typesense tools offers tools to index and fragment Ghost posts to a Typesense index. It consists of two user facing tools:

- `typesense`, which is a CLI tool to batch index the full content of a Ghost install to a defined Typesense index
- `typesense-netlify`, which uses Netlify Functions to listen to Ghost webhooks and add, update, and remove posts to an Typesense index

> **Note:** This project is based on the work of the [Ghost Foundation's Algolia tools](https://github.com/TryGhost/algolia) and aims to provide a similar experience for [Typesense](https://typesense.org/), an open-source search engine alternative to Algolia.

### Ghost Typesense CLI

While the Typesense Netlify tool is useful to maintain your search index, the Ghost Typesense CLI is good for the initial indexing of the full post content of a site. See full install and user instructions in the package description [here](https://github.com/magicpages/ghost-typesense/tree/master/packages/typesense).
